# BitcoinTicker
This app was originally a practice project from The App Brewery's iOS 11 & Swift 4 course. The original version featured the scroll wheel to determine the currency, and updated the current price of bitcoin accordingly from X's API. I added the toggle to switch between daily, weekly, and monthly prices (and implemented the logic to handle the API calls) of my own volition.

It is worth noting that while the base app was part of a guided lesson, I did build the app from the ground up, it was not just a matter of downloading a completed project.
